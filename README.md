# Ernesto_DNA_Algorithm
*Still need to refactor this code. Built in a few hours to get a working model. Many things to modularize and increase efficiency
Algorithm Implementation Practice 
Needleman Wunsch Algorithm to Compare Two DNA strands. 

Program Summary
 * Program takes DNA sequences as input strings and finds a global alignment based on match score, mismatch score and gap penalty
 * uses Needleman Wunsch algorithm to find scores, then using class tracback an alignment is found
